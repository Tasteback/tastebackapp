<h4>Our Story</h4>
<p>Hi! I am Annie. Two years ago I started having severe stomach problems. Since then I have been diagnosed with a small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In order to reduce my symptoms I have been following a low FODMAP diet for over a year and a SCD diet for about 6 months.

My journey with the low FODMAP diet has been a process in learning how to be mindful of every ingredient I am putting in my body and really watching what I eat. This journey has meant that I have needed to cook all of my own meals and not eat out. I have missed being able to eat out at restaurants with my friends, so I am working to find SIBO friendly restaurants in Portland Oregon!</p>
